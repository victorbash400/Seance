# Code Modification Policy

## CRITICAL RULE: NO UNSOLICITED CODE CHANGES

**NEVER edit, create, modify, or generate any code files unless the user explicitly commands it.**

### What This Means:
- Do NOT create example files
- Do NOT generate sample code
- Do NOT modify existing files
- Do NOT create new components, utilities, or any code files
- Do NOT create markdown files with code examples
- Do NOT make "helpful" improvements to existing code

### Only Provide Code When:
- User explicitly says "create", "edit", "modify", "generate", "write", or similar action words
- User directly asks for a specific file to be created or changed
- User requests code examples in chat (provide in response, don't create files)

### Default Behavior:
- Analyze and discuss code when asked
- Provide explanations and suggestions in chat
- Answer questions about the codebase
- Help with debugging by examining existing files
- Recommend approaches without implementing them

### Exception:
- Only steering documents in `.kiro/steering/` may be created/modified when explicitly requested for project guidance

**Remember: The user is in complete control of when code changes happen. Your role is to advise, not to act without permission.**
